#  ESP32-Based 3-Phase Energy Meter

This project is a **3-Phase Energy Monitoring System** built using the **ESP32**, capable of accurately measuring voltage, current, apparent power, and energy (kWh) for **each phase (A, B, C)**. It displays real-time data on a **20x4 I2C LCD** and logs energy values into **EEPROM**, making it ideal for industrial or lab applications.

##  Serial Monitor Output

Serial output will look like this (9600 baud):

```
Phase |    V (V) |    I (A) |    P (W) |   kWh
------------------------------------------------
  A   |   220.5   |   0.50  |   110.0  |   0.004
  B   |   215.2   |   0.75  |   161.4  |   0.006
  C   |   221.3   |   0.00  |     0.0  |   0.003
------------------------------------------------
Total kWh:   0.013
```

##  EEPROM Logging

Energy values are written to EEPROM every **5 minutes** if there's a 0.005 kWh increase:

| EEPROM Address | Stores  |
|----------------|---------|
| 0              | kWhA    |
| 4              | kWhB    |
| 8              | kWhC    |

##  Calibration Values

Ensure accurate measurements by calibrating your sensors. Below are the optimized calibration values used in the code:

| Phase | Voltage Calibration | Current Calibration |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|
| A     | 83.3                 | 216.4               |
| B     | 80.2                 | 171.9               |
| C     | 85.8                 | 171.9               |
